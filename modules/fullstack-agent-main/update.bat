rem Pulls the newest version of every installed piece, and of this repo.
rem Your files live outside the repos, so updates never touch them. If git
rem reports a conflict on a config you edited, your edit wins.

rem cmd reads a .bat by byte offset, so a script that pulls a new copy of
rem ITSELF mid-run gets garbled from that point on. Relaunch from a copy
rem before doing any work.
rem
rem The copy lives in this program's own folder under LOCALAPPDATA and NOT
rem in the system temp directory. Identical protection, and it stops the
rem script reading like something stashing an executable where nobody
rem looks. Reviewers read repos too, and copy-to-temp-then-run is the
rem shape people are trained to distrust.
rem
rem Invoked WITHOUT `call` deliberately: cmd hands control to the copy and
rem never returns here, so not one further byte of this file is read after
rem the pull rewrites it. If the copy cannot be made, execution falls
rem through to :run below and does the work in place.
